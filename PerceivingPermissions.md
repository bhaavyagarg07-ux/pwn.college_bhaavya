# Perceiving Permission


## Changing file ownership
change the owner of the /flag file to the hacker user, and then read the flag

### Solve
**Flag** `pwn.college{8zhpsvAAedXu8p9rpS518D344xK.QXxEjN0wSN0kjNzEzW}`

```bash
chown hacker /flag
pwn.college{8zhpsvAAedXu8p9rpS518D344xK.QXxEjN0wSN0kjNzEzW}
```
### New Learnings
using chown we can change the ownership of file.

## Groups and Files
change the group who can access the flag file from root to hacker

**Flag** `pwn.college{MW1LdZcXJmBHho_BQPNndq7aVPg.QXxcjM1wSN0kjNzEzW}`

```bash
ls -l
chgrp hacker not-the-flag
cat not-the-flag
pwn.college{MW1LdZcXJmBHho_BQPNndq7aVPg.QXxcjM1wSN0kjNzEzW}
```
### New Learnings
using chgrp we can change the group of files

## Fun with group names
find the group we are in and then with that group name we should change the accessibility to the flag file

**Flag** `pwn.college{giKKUCUonzG7YBjonlR5vXjlNC3.QXycjM1wSN0kjNzEzW}`

```bash
id
chgrp grp9392 not-the-flag
cat not-the-flag
pwn.college{giKKUCUonzG7YBjonlR5vXjlNC3.QXycjM1wSN0kjNzEzW}
```
### New Learnings
id cammand show all the users and group identity

Challenge Description


## Changing Permissions
get reading permission to the flag file and read the flag without changing the owner of the file.

**Flag** `pwn.college{IQjT30gXoSgkCtVuyl-sOGGHYfc.QXzcjM1wSN0kjNzEzW}`

```bash
chmod a+r /flag
cat /flag
pwn.college{IQjT30gXoSgkCtVuyl-sOGGHYfc.QXzcjM1wSN0kjNzEzW}
```
### New Learnings
we use +add permission - remove permission to 
to remove any confussion i used a+r giving permission to all users and groups

## Permission Setting Practice
In this challenge we should give ourselves execution permission to /challenge/run and then execute it to get the flag

**Flag** `pwn.college{gDd4FV-76yfF4j3jbgy1-hf-32H.QXyEjN0wSN0kjNzEzW}`

```bash
chmod a+x /challenge/run
/challenge/run
pwn.college{gDd4FV-76yfF4j3jbgy1-hf-32H.QXyEjN0wSN0kjNzEzW}
```
### New Learnings
used a+x to give everyone executing permissions

## Permission Tweaking Practice
In this challenge we should keep on changing the permissions to user,group and world using chmod, for 8 rounds and then get reading permissions to read the flag file

**Flag** `pwn.college{oJN65-mOZNm-ZaX3GF7vzHjkQnU.QXwEjN0wSN0kjNzEzW}`

```bash
/challenge/run
