# Citadel CTF

## Zahards welcome
flag was available in the discord server 

## The social network
instagram and twitter handles flags was available

## track 8
researched about pachinko album and it was vinegar it ressembles the decryption method vigenere 
using that got the flag

## Omniscient Flag's metadata
it striked my head that the picture is suspicious using llm i found out it had a png image hidden inside jpg image further useing steganographer seperator got the other image which had flag written

## Test of Sweetness
clciked on inspect and cookies changes the settings from user to admin and refreshed the website got the flag

## Rotten Apple 
in the hint the word rot was given hinting that rot 47 and rot 13 was used

## Randomly Accessed Memories
was going through the commits then some secret commits were there checked those and found out the flag was split into 3 parts and saved 

## Selected Ambient Work
after playing the wav file citadel with bracket and morse code was written. using online morse code reader read the flag and altered it according to the challenge

## Rotting in the Deep
using the hint the flag is converted into numbers and shifted 3 digits ahead. undoing this got the flag

        if not line:

        print(line_str)  # Optional: see server messages

        # Check for the flag

        m = re.search(r'Round \d+: (\d+)', line_str)
        if m:
            n = int(m.group(1))
            ans = collatz_steps(n)
            # Send answer immediately
            f.write(f"{ans}\n".encode())
            f.flush()
```
ran this in nano k.py and python3 k.py in wsl terminal


## schlagenhein
the wav file was corrupted and did not open. in the hint mid suggested midi file after using hex editor and playing in a online midi player the flag was displayed
